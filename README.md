How to install Catch:

2. Make sure you have Docker installed on your PC.
3. In Catch folder you'll find "run-catch" files (both .sh and .bat). Doubleclick on one of them and wait up to 2-3 minutes.
4. If you don't see any error, open a browser and connect to http://localhost/ and enjoy Catch.
5. If you need to stop docker containers you can use "stop-catch" files (again, .sh and .bat).
